# LeetcodeSolutions
This repository contains the leetcode questions which I have attempted and successfully completed.

Each folder represents a question on [leetcode.com](https://external.ink?to=/leetcode.com) and has the following structure:

LeetcodeXXYYY (where XX denotes the question number and YYY denotes the title of the question) <br>
&nbsp; | - question.md (A markdown file containing the question as shown on leetcode) <br>
&nbsp; | - solution.py (My solution to the question given) <br>
&nbsp; | - tests.py (The test cases which I used to aid in writing the code which passes all the test cases on leetcode)
